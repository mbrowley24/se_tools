Meeting and Data Tracking Tool for Sales Engineers

As a Sales Engineer, part of my role involves tracking meetings and analyzing data to help drive strategic decisions and improve outcomes for both clients and our internal teams. However, I found that the system I currently use could be more effective when it comes to collecting, organizing, and visualizing data from meetings.
Why Build This Tool?

Data analytics is a key component of my work, and after realizing that the existing tools lacked the flexibility and customization I needed, I decided to develop a solution that better suits my workflow. This tool is designed to:

    Easily track meetings with clients and team members.
    Capture key metrics that matter most to sales engineers and decision-makers.
    Visualize data in a meaningful way, making it simple to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.

Key Features:

    Customizable data tracking: Track the data points that matter most to you.
    Visual analytics dashboard: See your data in real-time with clear, informative visualizations.
    User-friendly interface: Make data entry and viewing simple and intuitive.

This project is aimed at creating a powerful, yet easy-to-use data tracking tool that fits seamlessly into the workflow of sales engineers like me.
